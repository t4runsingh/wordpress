Webflow Pages — Visual page builder
Build pages visually with the power of code in Webflow, then serve them right on your WordPress site.


== Description ==
Need to run your site on WordPress, but prefer to build your sites in Webflow? Fear not: now you can use Webflow’s WordPress plugin to build your site visually in Webflow, then serve one or more of those pages directly on your WordPress site. 

##How this helps you

How this makes your life easier:

* **Complete design control, without code.** No need to plunge into a custom WordPress development project to modify a theme — simply build your pages (or your entire site) visually in Webflow, without sacrificing on your unique design. ([More about building in Webflow vs. WordPress](https://webflow.com/vs/wordpress)).
* **Build new pages faster.** Need to spin up a promotional landing page or add something on top of an existing WordPress site? Build it in Webflow, serve it on your WordPress site, and rest easy knowing you don’t have to hack together a custom page in WordPress.
* **Update pages faster.** Once you’ve got your Webflow pages up on your WordPress site, pushing updates or adding new sections can be done in Webflow, then published live in a click.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a paid Webflow plan to use this plugin? =

Not necessarily. You can use this plugin with your free Webflow site, but Webflow projects without a paid site plan will be limited to 2 pages, 50 CMS items, and will display a “Made in Webflow” badge. Our recommendation is to use this plugin with a Webflow project that has a paid site plan.

= How do I learn Webflow? =

We have a ton of free resources on [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/) to help you get up and running.
